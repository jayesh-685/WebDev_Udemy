there's so much more that we could do with other languages like Python or Ruby, where we could

write, create web servers, we can interact with file systems, we can make command line tools, you

can make video games.

These are things that we couldn't really do with JavaScript until the advent of Node.

JS So Node is an implementation of JavaScript that runs outside of the browser.

So we can run JavaScript code without ever opening a browser, without even having a browser on our

machine.
