we need a (node) application to interact with our mongo db, which are called drivers and are available in diff languages.
we can use those, but we will be using mongoose which is a Object Document Mapper (ODM).
And Mongoose is one for Mongo and Node.js.

It connects the two, but it's more than just a basic driver that connects node to a mongo database.

It provides a lot of functionality that's useful on the JavaScript side of things, so it maps the data

that comes back from Mongo and the data that we want to insert into Mongo.

It maps them into these usable JavaScript objects that we can add methods to, we can add validations

to.
